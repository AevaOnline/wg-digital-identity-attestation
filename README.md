# Developer Identity Working Group

The intent of the OpenSSF Developer Identity Working Group is to make it easy
and possible for open source projects and maintainers to trust and verify the
identity of their maintainers and contributors.

## Goals/OKRs

## Non-Goals

Enforce or mandate identity requirements for projects.

projects and communities to adopt if they choose to do so.
